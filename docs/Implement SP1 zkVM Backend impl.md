Verification of Requirements Implementation:
Requirement 2.1: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
"WHEN ZK proofs are generated THEN the system SHALL submit proof commitments to ethrex L1 within 1 block time"

Implemented in EthrexIntegrationManager::submit_proof_commitment() method
Uses async processing to avoid blocking
Includes retry logic with exponential backoff
Requirement 2.2: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
"WHEN submitting to L1 THEN the system SHALL include merkle roots of order book state in the commitment"

Implemented in ProofCommitmentRequest struct with order_book_merkle_root field
Included in the submit_proof_commitment() method parameters
Encoded in the commitment data sent to L1
Requirement 2.3: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
"WHEN L1 transactions are confirmed THEN the system SHALL update local state with L1 block references"

Implemented in update_transaction_confirmations() method
Updates L1CommitmentRecord with L1 block number
Tracks confirmation status through ConfirmationStatus enum
Requirement 2.6: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
"WHEN state anchoring occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain a mapping between local state and L1 commitments"

Implemented via state_commitment_mapping in EthrexL1Client
L1CommitmentRecord struct stores the mapping
get_commitment_record() method provides access to mappings
All sub-tasks are properly implemented:

✅ Create ethrex client wrapper for L1 interactions - EthrexL1Client provides comprehensive wrapper
✅ Implement proof commitment submission to L1 - submit_proof_commitment() method with retry logic
✅ Add state root anchoring functionality - submit_state_root_anchor() method implemented
✅ Handle L1 transaction confirmation and finality - FinalityTracker handles confirmation and finality events
