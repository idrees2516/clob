üîß Technical Features:
Multi-zkVM Support: Works with both ZisK and SP1 backends
Merkle Tree Implementation: Efficient order book state merkle root calculation
Concurrent Processing: Thread-safe operations with configurable concurrency limits
Retry Mechanisms: Exponential backoff for failed L1 submissions
Performance Monitoring: Detailed statistics and health checks
Priority Queuing: Configurable priority levels for urgent commitments
üìä Performance Characteristics:
Block Time Compliance: Submissions complete within 12s Ethereum block time
Concurrent Submissions: Configurable limits (default: 5 concurrent)
