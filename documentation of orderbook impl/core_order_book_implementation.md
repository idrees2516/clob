### Order

```rust
pub struct Order {
    pub id: OrderId,
    pub symbol: Symbol,
    pub side: Side,
    pub price: u64,           // Fixed-point representation
    pub size: u64,            // Fixed-point representation

```

**Purpose**: Main order book data structure with comprehensive order management.

**Key Methods**:

#### Order Management
- `add_order()` - Add order with matching logic
- `cancel_order()` - Remove order from book
- `match_order()` - Execute matching algorithm

#### Market Data
- `get_best_bid()`, `get_best_ask()` - Best prices
- `get_spread()` - Bid-ask spread
- `get_mid_price()` - Mid-market price
- `get_market_depth()` - Multi-level depth snapshot
- `get_volume_at_or_better()` - Liquidity analysis

#### Analytics

- `match_against_ask()`, `match_against_bid()` - Level matching
- `add_order_to_book()` - Book insertion logic

## Matching Algorithm

### Price-Time Priority

The order book implements strict price-time priority:

1. **Price Priority**: Better prices are matched first
   - Bids: Higher prices have priority
   - Asks: Lower prices have priority

2. **Time Priority**: Within same price level, earlier orders are matched first
   - FIFO queue maintains temporal ordering
   - Timestamp-based tie breaking

### Matching Process

1. **Order Validation**: Comprehensive input validation
2. **Immediate Matching**: Check for crossing orders
3. **Level Matching**: Match against best available levels
4. **Trade Generation**: Create trade records with audit trail
5. **Book Updates**: Update price levels and order tracking
6. **Remainder Handling**: Add unfilled quantity to book

### Market Order Handling

Market orders are handled with special logic:
- Match against all available liquidity
- Walk through multiple price levels if needed
- Generate multiple trades for large orders
- No price limit - execute at any available price

## Fixed-Point Arithmetic

### Scaling Factors

```rust
pub const PRICE_SCALE: u64 = 1_000_000;   // 6 decimal places
pub const VOLUME_SCALE: u64 = 1_000_000;  // 6 decimal places
```

### Benefits

- **Deterministic**: Consistent results across platforms
- **Precise**: No floating-point rounding errors
- **zkVM Compatible**: Integer arithmetic in circuits
- **Efficient**: Fast integer operations

### Usage Examples

```rust
// $50,000.123456 -> 50000123456
let price = (50000.123456 * PRICE_SCALE as f64) as u64;

// 0.123456 BTC -> 123456
let volume = (0.123456 * VOLUME_SCALE as f64) as u64;

// Convert back to float for display
let display_price = price as f64 / PRICE_SCALE as f64;
let display_volume = volume as f64 / VOLUME_SCALE as f64;
```

## Error Handling

### OrderBookError Types

- `InvalidOrder` - Order validation failures
- `OrderNotFound` - Order lookup failures
- `InvalidPrice` - Price validation errors
- `InvalidSize` - Size validation errors
- `InvalidTimestamp` - Timestamp validation errors
- `SymbolMismatch` - Symbol consistency errors
- `InsufficientLiquidity` - Liquidity constraints
- `PriceLevelNotFound` - Level lookup failures
- `OrderBookLocked` - Concurrency errors
- `MaxOrdersExceeded` - Capacity limits

### Validation Strategy

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs at entry points
2. **State Validation**: Check internal consistency
3. **Business Logic Validation**: Enforce trading rules
4. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Graceful error handling

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity

- **Order Addition**: O(log n) for price level lookup + O(1) for FIFO insertion
- **Order Cancellation**: O(log n) for level lookup + O(k) for order removal
- **Best Price Lookup**: O(1) using BTreeMap first/last
- **Market Depth**: O(k) where k is number of levels requested
- **Matching**: O(m) where m is number of orders matched

### Space Complexity

- **Order Storage**: O(n) where n is total number of orders
- **Price Levels**: O(p) where p is number of distinct prices
- **Indices**: O(n) for order ID to order mapping

### Optimizations

- **BTreeMap**: Efficient sorted price level storage
- **VecDeque**: Efficient FIFO queue operations
- **HashMap**: Fast order lookup by ID
- **AtomicU64**: Lock-free sequence numbering
- **Zero-Copy**: Minimal memory allocations

## Thread Safety

### Atomic Operations

- `sequence_number`: AtomicU64 for consistent ordering
- `next_trade_id`: AtomicU64 for unique trade IDs

### Synchronization Strategy

The current implementation is designed for single-threaded use with atomic counters for consistency. For multi-threaded environments, external synchronization is required.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

Comprehensive test coverage includes:

- **Order Creation**: Valid and invalid order scenarios
- **Price Level Operations**: FIFO queue management
- **Order Book Operations**: Add, cancel, match operations
- **Market Data**: Depth, spread, mid-price calculations
- **Validation**: Input validation and consistency checks
- **Edge Cases**: Empty book, single orders, large orders

### Test Categories

1. **Data Structure Tests**: Individual component testing
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end order flow testing
3. **Performance Tests**: Latency and throughput measurement
4. **Stress Tests**: High-volume order processing
5. **Validation Tests**: Error handling and recovery

## Usage Examples

### Basic Order Book Operations

```rust
use hf_quoting_liquidity_clob::orderbook::*;

// Create order book
let symbol = Symbol::new("BTCUSD")?;
let mut book = CentralLimitOrderBook::new(symbol.clone());

// Add limit order
let order = Order::new_limit(
    OrderId::new(1),
    symbol.clone(),
    Side::Buy,
    50000 * PRICE_SCALE,  // $50,000
    100 * VOLUME_SCALE,   // 0.1 BTC
    timestamp(),
);

let trades = book.add_order(order)?;

// Get market data
let depth = book.get_market_depth(5);
let stats = book.get_statistics();

// Cancel order
let cancelled = book.cancel_order(OrderId::new(1))?;
```

### Market Order Execution

```rust
// Add market order that crosses multiple levels
let market_order = Order::new_market(
    OrderId::new(2),
    symbol.clone(),
    Side::Buy,
    500 * VOLUME_SCALE,  // 0.5 BTC
    timestamp(),
);

let trades = book.add_order(market_order)?;

// Process resulting trades
for trade in trades {
    println!("Trade: {} BTC @ ${}", 
             trade.size as f64 / VOLUME_SCALE as f64,
             trade.price as f64 / PRICE_SCALE as f64);
}
```
