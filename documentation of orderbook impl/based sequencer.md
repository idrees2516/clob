Architecture Highlights
Based Rollup Design: Implements a based rollup where the L1 proposer (based sequencer) collects orders, creates batches, and submits them to L1 with proofs.

zkVM Integration: Seamlessly integrates with the existing zkVM infrastructure to generate zero-knowledge proofs for batch execution.

Data Availability: Multi-tier DA strategy with primary storage (EIP-4844) and backup (IPFS) for maximum reliability.

Dispute Resolution: Complete challenge/response system to handle disputes about batch validity.

Performance Optimization: Compression, caching, and batching strategies to minimize costs and maximize throughput.

The implementation satisfies all requirements from the specification:

Requirement 8.1: Horizontal scaling and fault tolerance
Requirement 8.2: Efficient memory management and network handling
Requirement 8.5: Data availability layer with blob storage
All subtasks have been completed and the main task "5. Based Rollup Integration" is now fully implemented and ready for use in the high-frequency quoting system.
