✅ Implemented Components:
Fractional Brownian Motion Generation (FractionalBrownianMotion)

Uses Cholesky decomposition for accurate covariance structure
Supports Hurst parameters in (0, 0.5) for rough volatility
Precomputes covariance matrix for efficiency
Generates correlated FBM paths and increments
Rough Volatility Path Simulation (RoughVolatilitySimulator)

Implements the SDE: dlog(σ_t) = -λ(log(σ_t) - θ)dt + ν dW_t^H
Combines mean reversion with fractional Brownian motion noise
Supports configurable parameters for vol-of-vol, mean reversion, and long-term variance
Volatility Clustering Detection (VolatilityClusteringDetector)

Rolling volatility analysis with configurable windows
Autocorrelation computation for squared returns
Threshold-based cluster identification
Statistical measures for volatility persistence
Hurst Parameter Estimation (HurstEstimator)

R/S Analysis: Rescaled Range method with linear regression
DFA Method: Detrended Fluctuation Analysis for robust estimation
Multiple window sizes for accurate scaling behavior
Automatic clamping to valid rough volatility range (0, 0.5)
