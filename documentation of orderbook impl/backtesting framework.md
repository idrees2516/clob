Robustness score calculation across all scenarios
Scenario-specific market data generation with realistic stress patterns
üèóÔ∏è Framework Architecture:
Modular Design: Separate components for data replay, execution simulation, performance analysis, statistical testing, optimization, and stress testing
Async/Await Support: Full async implementation for high-performance execution
Configurable: Comprehensive configuration system with sensible defaults
Error Handling: Robust error handling with detailed error types
Extensible: Easy to add new scenarios, metrics, and optimization algorithms
üìä Integration with Existing Systems:
Statistical Testing Module: Integrated with the existing statistical_testing.rs module
Stress Testing Module: Integrated with the existing stress_testing.rs module
Performance Metrics: Uses the existing performance calculation framework
Model Parameters: Compatible with the existing ModelParameters structure
