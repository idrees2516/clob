Summary of Implementation
I have successfully implemented the High-Frequency Quoting Strategy Engine with all four subtasks completed:

‚úÖ Task 4.1: Optimal Bid-Ask Spread Calculation
Implemented closed-form solutions from equations (9.18)-(9.21) in the research paper
Inventory-dependent spread adjustment using reservation price calculation
Adverse selection cost modeling with Glosten-Milgrom adaptations
Market impact aware spread optimization using square-root law
Hawkes process intensity adjustments for order flow modeling
‚úÖ Task 4.2: Inventory Management System
Inventory penalty functions from equations (6.14)-(6.17) with quadratic, time-dependent, asymmetric, and liquidity penalties
Position limit enforcement with soft and hard limits
Automatic position reduction strategies with urgency levels and market-aware execution
Inventory skew adjustment for quotes based on current position and risk parameters
Emergency liquidation procedures with configurable thresholds and execution strategies
‚úÖ Task 4.3: Adaptive Quoting Parameters
Volatility-based spread adjustment using EWMA and historical volatility comparison
Liquidity-aware quote sizing based on market depth and volume profiles
Market regime detection and adaptation with 5 regime types (Normal, High Volatility, Low Liquidity, Crisis, Recovery)
Correlation-based multi-asset adjustments with real-time correlation tracking and portfolio optimization
‚úÖ Task 4.4: Risk Management Controls
Real-time drawdown monitoring with consecutive loss tracking
Automatic trading halt mechanisms via multiple circuit breakers (price, volume, PnL, time-based)
Position size limits and enforcement with graduated warning levels
Emergency liquidation procedures with market impact constraints and timeout mechanisms
