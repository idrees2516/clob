# Implemented Features

This document details the features that are considered fully implemented in the project.

## 1. Limit Order Book (LOB)

- **Description:** A complete implementation of a limit order book with price-time priority. It supports adding, canceling, and matching orders.
- **Implementation:** The LOB is implemented in the `models::lob` module. It uses efficient data structures to manage buy and sell orders and provides methods for accessing the best bid and ask, order book depth, and other market data.
- **Status:** Fully implemented.

## 2. Rough Volatility Modeling

- **Description:** The project includes a model for rough volatility using fractional Brownian motion. This allows for more realistic simulation of price dynamics compared to traditional volatility models.
- **Implementation:** The rough volatility model is located in the `models::lob_rough_vol` module. It provides functions for simulating price paths and volatility surfaces.
- **Status:** Fully implemented.

## 3. High-Performance Matching Engine

- **Description:** The matching engine is designed for high performance, using an event-driven architecture to process orders and generate trades with low latency.
- **Implementation:** The matching logic is part of the LOB implementation in `models::lob`. It is optimized for speed and is capable of handling a high volume of orders.
- **Status:** Fully implemented.

## 4. Concurrency and Thread Safety

- **Description:** The core data structures, including the LOB, are designed to be thread-safe, allowing for concurrent access from multiple threads.
- **Implementation:** The project uses synchronization primitives from the `parking_lot` crate to ensure safe concurrent access to shared data. This makes the system suitable for multi-threaded applications, such as a real-time trading system.
- **Status:** Fully implemented.

## 5. Order Types

- **Description:** The system supports a range of standard order types.
- **Implementation:** The supported order types include:
    - **Market Orders:** Executed immediately at the best available price.
    - **Limit Orders:** Executed at a specified price or better.
    - **Time-in-Force Options:** Good 'Til Canceled (GTC), Immediate or Cancel (IOC), and Fill or Kill (FOK).
- **Status:** Fully implemented.

## 6. Spread Estimation (Roll's Model)

- **Description:** The project includes an implementation of Roll's model for estimating the effective bid-ask spread from transaction data. The model is adjusted to account for serial dependence in price changes.
- **Implementation:** The Roll's model estimator is located in the `estimators::roll_improved` module.
- **Status:** Fully implemented.

## 7. Error Handling

- **Description:** The project has a comprehensive error handling strategy, with custom error types for different modules.
- **Implementation:** The `error.rs` file defines several error types, such as `LOBError`, `MatchingError`, and `VolatilityError`. This allows for granular error handling and clear reporting of issues.
- **Status:** Fully implemented.
