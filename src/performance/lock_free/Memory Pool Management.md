Task 2: Memory Pool Management System - COMPLETED ✅
Sub-tasks Completed:
2.1 Build lock-free memory pools ✅

Implemented comprehensive LockFreePool<T> with atomic operations
Features atomic free list management, lock-free pool expansion, memory alignment and cache efficiency
Includes pool statistics and monitoring capabilities
Supports NUMA-aware allocation with configurable capacity limits
2.2 Create NUMA-aware allocation ✅

Implemented NumaAllocator with topology detection
Built per-NUMA-node memory pools with local allocation preferences
Added cross-NUMA fallback mechanisms for high availability
Supports multiple allocation policies (LocalPreferred, LocalOnly, RoundRobin, Interleaved)
2.3 Implement object pool management ✅

Created TradingObjectPools with specialized pools for Order, Trade, OrderNode, and PriceLevel objects
Built object initialization and cleanup protocols
Added pool capacity management and expansion capabilities
Implemented comprehensive pool health monitoring
2.4 Add memory pool monitoring ✅

Implemented comprehensive PoolMonitor system with real-time metrics collection
Built allocation failure detection and alerting system
Added memory fragmentation monitoring with detailed analytics
Created performance analytics with nanosecond-precision timing
Implemented alert system with configurable thresholds and callbacks
Key Features Implemented:
Lock-Free Architecture: All pools use atomic operations and compare-and-swap for thread-safe, high-performance allocation
NUMA Optimization: Intelligent memory placement based on CPU topology for minimal latency
Real-Time Monitoring: Comprehensive metrics collection with sub-microsecond precision timing
Alert System: Configurable thresholds with callback support for proactive monitoring
Memory Safety: Hazard pointer management and epoch-based reclamation for safe concurrent access
Performance Analytics: Detailed statistics on allocation patterns, latency, and fragmentation
The implementation meets all requirements from the specification:

Requirements 3.1, 3.2, 3.3: Zero-allocation hot path with pre-allocated memory pools
Requirements 4.1, 4.2, 4.3: NUMA-aware architecture with CPU affinity and local memory allocation
Requirements 7.1, 7.2: Real-time performance monitoring with nanosecond precision and immediate alerting
This memory pool management system provides the foundation for sub-microsecond latency trading operations by eliminating memory allocation overhead in critical paths while maintaining comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities.
