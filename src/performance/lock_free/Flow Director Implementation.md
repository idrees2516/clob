Flow Director Implementation Summary
Core Components
FlowDirector - Main classification engine with:

Rule-based packet classification with priority ordering
RSS (Receive Side Scaling) for load balancing
QoS (Quality of Service) management
Connection tracking with flow table
Hardware-accelerated hash functions (Toeplitz, CRC32, xxHash)
Flow Rules - Flexible matching criteria:

IP address ranges (IPv4/IPv6 CIDR and ranges)
Port ranges
Protocol filtering
VLAN ID matching
Payload pattern matching with masks
Packet type classification
