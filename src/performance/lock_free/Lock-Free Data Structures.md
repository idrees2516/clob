Task 9.1 Completion Summary
I implemented comprehensive lock-free data structures with hazard pointers and epoch-based memory reclamation:

1. Lock-Free Order Book (already existed)
Complete lock-free order book implementation with sub-microsecond latency
Uses hazard pointers for memory safety
Supports concurrent add/remove/cancel operations
Cache-line aligned structures to prevent false sharing
2. Lock-Free Skip List (newly implemented)
Probabilistic data structure with O(log n) operations
Lock-free insertion, deletion, and search
Hazard pointer protection for memory safety
Epoch-based memory reclamation for better performance
Iterator support for ordered traversal
3. Lock-Free Hash Map (newly implemented)
Separate chaining with lock-free linked lists
Concurrent insert, get, remove operations
Dynamic resizing based on load factor
Hazard pointer and epoch-based memory management
Comprehensive statistics and monitoring
4. Lock-Free Object Pool (newly implemented)
High-performance memory management for frequent allocations
RAII wrapper (PooledObject) for automatic return to pool
Configurable pool size limits
Factory function support for object creation
Thread-safe acquire/release operations
5. Supporting Infrastructure (already existed)
Hazard Pointers: Thread-safe memory reclamation
Epoch-Based Reclamation: High-performance alternative to hazard pointers
Atomic Operations: Optimized memory ordering operations
Memory Reclamation: Hybrid approach combining both methods
Key Features Implemented:
✅ Lock-free order book with hazard pointers and atomic operations
✅ Lock-free hash map for order storage with memory reclamation
✅ Lock-free skip list for price level management
✅ Epoch-based memory reclamation for safe concurrent access
✅ Cache-line alignment to prevent false sharing
✅ Comprehensive testing with concurrent stress tests
✅ Performance monitoring and statistics collection

All implementations follow the requirements from task 9.1:

Sub-microsecond latency operations
Memory-safe concurrent access
Hazard pointer protection
Epoch-based memory reclamation
Cache-optimized data structures
The lock-free infrastructure is now ready to support the ultra-low latency performance requirements of the advanced trading system. Task 9.1 is complete!
