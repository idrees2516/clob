‚úÖ Task 7: TWAP Execution Engine with Adaptive Scheduling - COMPLETED
üéØ Implementation Summary
I successfully implemented a sophisticated TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) execution system with all four subtasks completed:

‚úÖ 7.1 Core TWAP Implementation
TWAPExecutor: Complete implementation with configurable time bucketing
Equal time interval division: Proper volume allocation across buckets
Execution rate calculation: Implemented v(t) = X/(T-t‚ÇÄ) formula
Participation rate targeting: Basic and adaptive participation rate management
Comprehensive testing: Full test coverage with property-based testing
‚úÖ 7.2 Volume Forecasting and Adaptation
VolumeForecaster: Advanced intraday volume pattern analysis
Historical data integration: Support for 30+ days of volume history
Real-time forecasting: Seasonality adjustments and market condition adaptation
Adaptive bucket sizing: Dynamic volume allocation based on expected patterns
Participation rate adjustment: Real-time adaptation to market conditions
‚úÖ 7.3 Market Impact Optimization
MarketImpactModel: Square-root law implementation for impact estimation
Impact decomposition: Separate temporary and permanent impact modeling
Execution cost optimization: Impact-timing trade-off optimization
Slippage analysis: Comprehensive performance attribution
Optimal trajectory calculation: Almgren-Chriss model implementation
‚úÖ 7.4 Adaptive Execution Control
AdaptiveExecutionController: Complete control system with contingency planning
Catch-up mechanisms: Automatic shortfall detection and acceleration
Slowdown logic: Surplus management with timing risk consideration
Market condition adaptation: Volatility, liquidity, and news impact handling
