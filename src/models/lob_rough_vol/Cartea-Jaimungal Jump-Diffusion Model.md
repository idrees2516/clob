Added regime-dependent jump risk premiums with different multipliers for each regime
Implemented jump clustering adjustment for spread widening during clustering periods
Created comprehensive risk premium calculation with detailed component breakdown
Task 6.4: Jump-Diffusion SDE Integration ✅

Implemented numerical validation and stability testing to ensure model robustness
Created JumpAdjustedQuotes structure that provides final bid/ask prices with all jump adjustments
Key Features Implemented
Mathematical Rigor: All formulas follow the academic literature with proper expected jump size calculations, bi-power variation tests, and maximum likelihood estimation.

Regime Awareness: The system adapts jump detection thresholds and risk premiums based on market regimes (Normal, High Volatility, Crisis, Recovery).

Inventory Sensitivity: Asymmetric adjustments based on inventory position - long positions get protection against negative jumps, short positions against positive jumps.

Clustering Detection: Uses Hawkes process framework to detect jump clustering periods and adjust spreads accordingly.

Numerical Stability: Comprehensive validation ensures parameters remain within stable bounds and provides warnings/errors for potentially unstable configurations.

Comprehensive Testing: Extensive unit tests cover all major functionality including edge cases and error conditions.

The implementation successfully integrates sophisticated jump-diffusion modeling with practical market making, providing a complete solution for trading under jump risk as specified in the Cartea-Jaimungal framework.
