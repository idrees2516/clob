# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive High Frequency Quoting system under liquidity constraints based on the research paper "High Frequency Quoting Under Liquidity Constraints" (arXiv:2507.05749v1). The system will implement advanced market making strategies, optimal quoting algorithms, and liquidity management techniques for high-frequency trading environments.

The implementation will be production-ready, highly performant, and follow Rust best practices with complete mathematical model implementations, real-time processing capabilities, and comprehensive risk management features.
