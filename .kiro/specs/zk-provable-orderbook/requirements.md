# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates multiple zero-knowledge virtual machines (ZisK and SP1) with ethrex (Ethereum client) and advanced data availability sampling techniques to create a provable, high-performance decentralized exchange infrastructure. The system leverages the existing advanced data availability layer with polynomial commitments, Reed-Solomon erasure coding, and sophisticated sampling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and availability while maintaining sub-microsecond trading latency.

The integration transforms the current centralized order book into a hybrid zkVM-powered system where:
- Order matching and execution remain high-performance (sub-microsecond latency)
- All operations are cryptographically provable through multiple zkVM backends (ZisK, SP1)
- Advanced data availability sampling ensures 99.99% data availability with minimal storage overhead
- Polynomial commitments and erasure coding provide cryptographic guarantees of data integrity
- State commitments and proofs are anchored to Ethereum L1 via ethrex
- Sophisticated archival systems with data availability sampling enable efficient historical data access
- The system maintains regulatory compliance and full auditability through cryptographic proofs

Key technical innovations include:
- Multi-zkVM architecture supporting both ZisK and SP1 for different proof types
- Advanced polynomial commitment schemes for efficient data verification
- Reed-Solomon erasure coding with configurable redundancy levels
- Data availability sampling with probabilistic verification guarantees
- High-performance archival systems with indexed storage and compression
- Merkle tree-based data structures for tamper-evident storage
- Sophisticated caching and recovery mechanisms for fault tolerance
