# Performance Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for achieving sub-microsecond latency performance in the zkVM-optimized CLOB system to meet high-frequency trading (HFT) competitive requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Sub-Microsecond Order Processing

**User Story:** As a high-frequency trader, I want order-to-trade latency under 1 microsecond, so that I can compete effectively in HFT markets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order is submitted THEN the system SHALL process it in <1 microsecond (99th percentile)
2. WHEN measuring end-to-end latency THEN the system SHALL achieve <500 nanoseconds median latency
3. WHEN processing 1M+ orders per second THEN the system SHALL maintain latency targets
4. WHEN under peak load THEN the system SHALL not exceed 2 microseconds (99.9th percentile)

### Requirement 2: Lock-Free Data Structures

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want lock-free concurrent data structures, so that thread contention doesn't impact trading latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple threads access the order book THEN the system SHALL use lock-free algorithms
2. WHEN orders are matched THEN the system SHALL avoid all mutex/lock operations in hot path
3. WHEN price levels are updated THEN the system SHALL use atomic operations only
4. WHEN memory is allocated THEN the system SHALL use pre-allocated memory pools

### Requirement 3: Memory Pool Management

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want zero-allocation trading operations, so that garbage collection doesn't cause latency spikes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing orders THEN the system SHALL not allocate memory in hot path
2. WHEN creating trade objects THEN the system SHALL use pre-allocated object pools
3. WHEN memory pools are exhausted THEN the system SHALL expand pools without blocking trades
4. WHEN system starts THEN the system SHALL pre-allocate sufficient memory for peak load

### Requirement 4: NUMA-Aware Architecture

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want NUMA-aware memory allocation, so that memory access latency is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN threads are created THEN the system SHALL pin them to specific CPU cores
2. WHEN memory is allocated THEN the system SHALL prefer local NUMA node memory
3. WHEN data structures are accessed THEN the system SHALL minimize cross-NUMA traffic
4. WHEN system topology changes THEN the system SHALL adapt NUMA configuration

### Requirement 5: Zero-Copy Networking

**User Story:** As a network engineer, I want zero-copy network operations, so that network I/O doesn't impact trading latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving orders THEN the system SHALL use kernel bypass networking (io_uring/DPDK)
2. WHEN sending market data THEN the system SHALL avoid memory copies
3. WHEN processing network packets THEN the system SHALL use ring buffers
4. WHEN network congestion occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain low latency for priority traffic

### Requirement 6: CPU Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want CPU-optimized code paths, so that instruction-level performance is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing hot paths THEN the system SHALL use SIMD instructions where applicable
2. WHEN branching in code THEN the system SHALL optimize for branch prediction
3. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL optimize for CPU cache efficiency
4. WHEN performing calculations THEN the system SHALL use vectorized operations

### Requirement 7: Real-Time Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want nanosecond-precision performance monitoring, so that I can detect performance regressions immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring latency THEN the system SHALL provide nanosecond-precision timestamps
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert within 1 second
3. WHEN collecting metrics THEN the system SHALL not impact trading performance
4. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide detailed latency histograms

### Requirement 8: Auto-Scaling and Load Management

**User Story:** As a capacity planner, I want automatic scaling based on trading volume, so that performance is maintained under variable load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trading volume increases THEN the system SHALL scale resources automatically
2. WHEN CPU utilization exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL add processing capacity
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL expand memory pools
4. WHEN network bandwidth is saturated THEN the system SHALL implement traffic shaping
