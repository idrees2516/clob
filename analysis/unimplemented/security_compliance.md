## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks (Regulatory Blockers)
1. **Regulatory Non-Compliance** - Cannot operate without regulatory approval
2. **Data Breach** - Could result in massive fines and reputational damage
3. **Market Manipulation** - Could lead to trading license revocation
4. **AML Violations** - Could result in criminal liability

### High Risks
1. **Insider Trading** - Lack of monitoring could enable illegal activities
2. **Cybersecurity Incidents** - Could compromise trading operations
3. **Privacy Violations** - Could result in GDPR fines up to 4% of revenue
4. **Operational Risk** - Could lead to trading losses and client harm

### Medium Risks
1. **Third-Party Risk** - Vendor security issues could impact operations
2. **Configuration Drift** - Could create security vulnerabilities
3. **Access Control Failures** - Could enable unauthorized activities

The security and compliance work is absolutely critical for regulatory approval and operational safety. Without comprehensive security and compliance frameworks, the trading venue cannot operate legally or safely in regulated markets.
